    <h2>UNCLE VANYA - Anton Checkov</h2>
    <p>
        VOITSKI takes a bottle from the drawer of the table and hands it to ASTROFF.
        
        <b>VOITSKI</b>. There it is! [To SONIA] And now, we must get to work at once; we must do something, or else I shall not be able to endure it.
        
        <b>SONIA</b>. Yes, yes, to work! As soon as we have seen them off we shall go to work. [She nervously straightens out the papers on the table]
        Everything is in a muddle!
        
        <b>ASTROFF</b>. [Putting the bottle in his case, which he straps together] Now
        I can be off.

        HELENA. comes in.

        <b>HELENA</b>. Are you here, Ivan? We are starting in a moment. Go to Alexander, he wants to speak to you.

        <b>SONIA</b>. Go, Uncle Vanya. [She takes VOITSKI 'S arm] Come, you and papa
        must make peace; that is absolutely necessary.

        SONIA and VOITSKI go out.

        <b>HELENA</b>. I am going away. [She gives ASTROFF her hand] Good-bye.

        <b>ASTROFF</b>. So soon?

        <b>HELENA</b>. The carriage is waiting.

        <b>ASTROFF</b>. Good-bye.

        <b>HELENA</b>. You promised me you would go away yourself to-day.

        <b>ASTROFF</b>. I have not forgotten. I am going at once. [A pause] Were you
        frightened? Was it so terrible?

        <b>HELENA</b>. Yes.

        <b>ASTROFF</b>. Couldn't you stay? Couldn't you? To-morrow--in the forest--

        <b>HELENA</b>. No. It is all settled, and that is why I can look you so bravely
        in the face. Our departure is fixed. One thing I must ask of you: don't
        think too badly of me; I should like you to respect me.
